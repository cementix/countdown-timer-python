# countdown-timer-python

Description: 
Super short project: Timer that plays a sound when it reaches 00:00. 100% python. Runs in your terminal. Requires pip playsound to run.

The code contains a bunch of notes to help understand the process.

When running the program, the terminal will ask you to pick how many minutes you wanat the timer to be set for.
Set the minutes and press enter.
Then it will ask you to put in how many seconds you want the timer to be set for.
Set the seconds and press enter.
Then the program starts running.

Requires playsound package.

To install playsound package:
      - in terminal: pip install playsound
      - if this returns an error when running the program, downgrade to "pip install playsound==1.2.2" (this is what worked for me)
